==========
Quickstart
==========

Heroku-hook was tested under Debian and Ubuntu, and all auto-build scripts are prepared for those environments. However,
nothing stands in the way to install it on other distributions. Please refer to :ref:`manual installation<install-manual>`
guide for more details.

To start, all you need, is a clean distribution, and root access.

Automatic installer
===================

You can do most of the work automatically via the command-line with either ``curl`` or ``wget``. Root access is
required, so it is a good idea to look at the script before installation. It will also help with debugging, when
something goes wrong.

via curl
--------

    curl -Lk http://goo.gl/BHuZGC | sh

via wget
--------

    wget --no-check-certificate http://goo.gl/BHuZGC -O - | sh
